            <li>Fighters with high takedown attempts often prefer to control the fight on the ground and may have a wrestling-heavy style.</li>
            <li>A high takedown attempt value could suggest a fighter’s confidence in their grappling, possibly looking for a ground-and-pound or submission finish.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <li>Frequent submission attempts suggest a fighter’s ability to create opportunities on the ground, either to force a tap-out or create openings for other techniques.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Total Wins</h4>

        <li><strong>Insights</strong>: 
          <ul>
            <li>Fighters with a high number of wins typically have a well-rounded skill set that allows them to adapt to various fight situations.</li>
            <li>A high win total may also indicate experience and mental toughness, especially in high-pressure or championship-level fights.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Overall Insights from the Heatmap</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fighter Comparison</strong>: The heatmap makes it easy to compare how different fighters approach a fight. For example, a fighter with high strikes but low takedowns might focus on striking, while one with high takedowns and submissions may have a grappling-heavy strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Patterns</strong>: By analyzing trends in a fighter’s statistics, you can gain insights into their evolving fighting style over the years. For example, a fighter’s increase in submissions over time might indicate a shift towards a more grappling-focused approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong>: The heatmap helps identify a fighter's strengths and weaknesses, enabling analysts or fans to make predictions about how they might perform against certain opponents, based on their style and averages.</li>
        <li><strong>Fighter Evolution</strong>: Tracking changes in metrics (e.g., a fighter's increased takedown attempts or strikes thrown) can provide insights into their development, adaptation, and refinement of techniques.</li>

      <h4>What This Code Is Trying to Find Out:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Average Fighter Performance: The code calculates the average number of strikes, takedowns, and submission attempts per fight for each year. It also calculates win percentages for different methods (KO/TKO, submission, and decision wins) for each fighter.</li>
        <li>Trends Over Time: The data is grouped into 5-year periods (e.g., 2000-2004, 2005-2009) to visualize performance trends. This helps identify whether fighters' strategies have changed or if performance metrics have improved or declined over time.</li>
        <li>Yearly Breakdown: The data is broken down by individual years, allowing the chart to visualize performance year-over-year within each 5-year span.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>What the Performance Graph Displays:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Avg Strikes per Fight: The average number of strikes thrown by each fighter per fight, shown over the course of years in a given 5-year period. It helps measure the aggression and striking-focused strategy of fighters over time.</li>
        <li>Avg Takedowns per Fight: The average number of takedown attempts per fight, indicating a fighter's wrestling strategy and focus on controlling the fight on the ground.</li>
        <li>Avg Submission Attempts per Fight: The average number of submission attempts per fight, which shows a fighter's grappling strategy and their focus on ending fights through submissions.</li>
        <li>KO/TKO Win Percentage: The percentage of wins achieved by knockout (KO) or technical knockout (TKO), showing how often a fighter wins through striking finishes.</li>
        <li>Submission Win Percentage: The percentage of wins achieved by submission, reflecting how often fighters win through grappling and submissions over time.</li>
        <li>Decision Win Percentage: The percentage of wins achieved by decision, indicating the frequency of fights going to the judges' scorecards and resulting in a decision.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Graph Visuals:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>X-axis: Represents the years within each 5-year period.</li>
        <li>Y-axis: Represents the average values per fight (e.g., number of strikes, takedowns, submissions) or percentages (e.g., KO/TKO %).</li>
        <li>Lines: Different lines are plotted for each metric, using distinct colors to represent each one (e.g., strikes might be in purple, takedowns in green, submissions in orange, etc.).</li>
        <li>Legend: A color-coded legend is provided to match each line with its corresponding metric, helping users interpret the graph.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Purpose and Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>This analysis enables UFC fans, analysts, or researchers to track how performance trends have shifted over time and which types of fighting strategies (e.g., striking vs. grappling) have become more or less common.</li>
        <li>It’s particularly useful for observing how the sport has evolved, including the dominance of particular types of victories or tactics across different periods.</li>
