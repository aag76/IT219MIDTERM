      <h3>What Is The UFC?</h3>
      <p>
        The UFC is a Mixed Martial Arts Organization that was founded on November 12, 1993, in Denver, Colorado. Its original purpose was for 
        martial artists of various disciplines like Karate, Boxing, Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Judo, and others to gather together and see which of their 
        martial arts were the most effective with minimal rules and no weight classes.

      <H3>What is Mixed Martial Arts?</H3>
      <p>
        Although at the conception of Mixed Martial Arts, it was only a ruleset, now it is a fullblown art and combat sport of its own. It combines various techniques from
        other martial arts disciplines like: striking from Boxing, Muay Thai, Karate, Kickboxing,etc , grappling from Sambo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, etc. The fighters fight 
        in an octogon in contrast to boxing in a ring where they use striking, takedowns, submissions to either win by decision or by knockout.
